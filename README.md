### Assessment: Real World Application - Part A

### Documentation

# UDOU - Built to Fit 
## Furniture ecommerce site with product configuration. 

### Purpose

We are building a full stack web application to function as a one way ecommerce platform for our client to sell user-configurable furniture items directly to consumers. 

### Functionality/Features

The website will be a one page application, with several dynamically rendered pages. Each will have several main components. There will be landing page with an image display carousel to display images with a call to action and button. There will also be a two column component to display information and images. As well as a card display carousel to display products and customer reviews. 

There will be a top nav bar across all pages with a page links to the main pages with a drop down secondary menu of furniture type categories. This menu will contain thumbnail images to illustrate the categories. 

Each category will have its own index page displaying the products in this category. There is a reactive form taking inputs to filter the results. The results are displayed as cards. 

Each product page will have a form taking inputs for product configuration (such as height, width, colour etc), there will be a dynamic representation of the cabinet that is updated as changes are made. 

The product page will have a button to purchase the product once it has been configured and the user will then be directed to sign up or login, before going to a cart, and then to checkout through a payment gateway. 

Once a purchase has been made, the user will be able to leave a review for their product through a form. 


### Target audience. 

The client for this project serves end consumers in a residential domestic market. The target user for the web app is the lead purchaser in a household that rents or owns their own home.

As Maria, I know exactly what I need and I want to be able to specify this, so I can make a good investment into improving my home.
